        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/Lasagna.jpg" alt="Picture of Lasagna">
        <p>In 1995 my mother went on a years long journey to find the perfect lasagna recipe.
          Through the foothills of Italy crossing through the small nations of San Marino,
          she would find something in Southern Italy, an old scroll from the Roman period.
          This scroll would contain one of the oldest lasagna recipes in the world.
          In this recipe I will be revealing the secrets that the scroll held and how to make the most delectable lasagna possible.

        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ul>
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <li>Add 1/2 cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven over low heat,
            Add onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes,
            until the onions are wilted. Season with salt and pepper. 
            Raise heat slightly, add wine and cook until reduced, about 20 minutes. 
            Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add tomato paste and 
            2 cups lukewarm water. Simmer for 1 hour.
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl.
            Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine, then stir into the beef mixture.
            Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix util all the ingredients are well blended.
            Shape into meatballs and set aside.
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 3</h3>
          <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            Dust the meatballs lightly with flour shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil.
            Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.  
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 4</h3>
          <li>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat.
            Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1 1/2 hours.
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 5</h3>
          <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, pecorino Romano, parsley and all but 1 cup of mozzarella.
            Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 6</h3>
          <li>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers, using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
