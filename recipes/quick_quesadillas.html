            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium heat and add the butter and oil and 
            let it get nice and hot.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Sprinkle the spices over the pieces of chicken as well as salt and 
            pepper, toss everything together to make sure each piece of chicken 
            is coated in the spices.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Add the chicken to the hot skillet and let it cook for about 7 to 8 
            minutes or until fully cooked through.</li>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>

            <br>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <li>When you’re ready to make the quesadillas, preheat a grill pan over 
            medium high heat (or a large skillet) brush one side of the tortilla
            with some vegetable oil and place it oiled side down onto a 
            plate.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <li>Sprinkle some cheese on one half of the tortilla, and then top that 
            with some of the cooked chicken and a bit more cheese.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <li>Fold it in half and place it on the grill pan, let it cook for about
             3 minutes on each side or until the cheese is melted on both sides 
            and it’s got nice golden brown ridges.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 8</h3>
