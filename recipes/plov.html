        <h4>Preparation</h4>
        <ul>
          <h3>Step 1</h3>
          <li>Combine oils in a 7-quart pot over medium-high head. 
              Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally,
               for 10 to 15 minutes until the onions "taste of oil" and are golden
               ;remove to plate.
          </li>
          <br>
          <h3>Step 2</h3>
          <li>Add the beef in 2 batches, cooking until browned on all sides, about 30 
              minutes. Return the beef and onions to the pot, then add 1 1/2 teaspoons of 
              the cumin seeds, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, the black pepper, half the 
              barberries and a handful of the carrots. Add enough water to cover, about 6 
              cups. Bring to a boil, then cover the pot and simmer over medium heat for 35 
              minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, wash the rice in a large sieve with cold 
            water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in warm water for 15 
            minutes to open it up, drain.</li>
            <br>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <li>Toss the remaining carrots with the remaining salt and the cayenne. 
                Spoon the carrots in a layer over the meat, adding more water if 
                needed to cover the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for just a few 
                minutes.</li>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <li>Without disturbing the carrots, spoon the rice gently on top. Cook, 
                stirring the rice every 10 minutes and making sure not to touch the 
                carrots until the water is evaporated and the rice cooked, about 30 
                minutes in all. Cover the pot and cook over low heat for 10 more 
                minutes.</li>
                <br>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <li>To serve, spoon the rice onto a large platter, then top with the 
                carrots and meat. Sprinkle the scallions on top, along with the 
                remaining cumin seeds, barberries and pomegranate seeds.</li>
        </ul>
